# SimpleTails

SimpleTails is inspired by [Simple.CSS](https://simplecss.org/) a classless CSS framework that makes semantic HTML look good.

I wanted a way to to have sensible styling in a Rails application with minimal setup with the added bonus of being abble to easily change the defaults or overide them.

SimpleTails leverages the [official Tailwind CSS Typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) `prose` classes with some custom setup.
This makes it possible to have default styling out the box.

All the magic is here: [simple_tails.css](app/assets/stylesheets/simple_tails.css)

> This Rails app exist for the purpose of of developing and refining SimpleTails.
